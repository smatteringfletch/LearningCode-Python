# Pizza Party

Max enjoys hosting pizza parties for his friends. Unfortunately, some of Max's friends eat much faster than the others, leaving the slower eaters hungry. Max would like to divide the pizza evenly amongst his friends instead, but he is very bad at maths. To address this problem, Max is asking you to write him a program which calculates how many slices each person should receive.

The program should ask for two inputs. The first input is the total number of pizza slices. The second input is the total number of people at the party.

Your program should then calculate the number of whole slices per person. Max does not own a pizza cutter, so partial slices are not allowed (e.g., 1.5 slices each is not possible). How do we calculate this value? Well, the number of slices per person is equal to the integer division of the total number of slices by the total number of people.

Finally, your program should print the result in the following format (where X is the value that you calculated):
