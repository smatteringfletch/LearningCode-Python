# Hello World

The below attempt was made at writing a program that greets whoever it is asked to, but this does not work as expected. 

```
# Ask for a recipient of the greeting.
person_to_greet = input('Who should I greet? ')

# Display the greeting message.
print('Goodbye ' + PERSON_TO_GREET)
```

Your task is to correct the code.
